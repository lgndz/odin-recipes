        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When you get right down to it, the Bourbon Old Fashioned is little more than a slug of whiskey, seasoned and sweetened. Yet for all of its suave simplicity, the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkers’ hearts 200 years ago. </p>
        <p>Start by using good bourbon, the rule being that if you wouldn’t sip it by itself it has no place at the helm of a Bourbon Old Fashioned. (There are other whiskey drinks for masking subpar booze—this isn’t one of them.) From there, the cocktail-minded seem to break into two camps: simple syrup or muddled sugar.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>2 ounces bourbon</li>
            <li>Garnish: orange peel</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the sugar and bitters to a rocks glass, then add the water, and stir until the sugar is nearly dissolved.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass with large ice cubes, add the bourbon, and gently stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Express the oil of an orange peel over the glass, then drop in.</li>
        </ol>
